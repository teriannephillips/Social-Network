## Description
The challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. It also uses the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
